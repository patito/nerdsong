If you wanna hang out you've got to take bugs out; caffeine
If you wanna get root, root all around; caffeine
She don't lie, she don't lie, she don't lie; caffeine

If you got bad bugs, you wanna kick them bulls; caffeine
When your day is out and you wanna ship; caffeine
She don't lie, she don't lie, she don't lie; caffeine

If your time is gone and you wanna hang out; caffeine
Don't forget the fact, the bugs will be back; caffeine
